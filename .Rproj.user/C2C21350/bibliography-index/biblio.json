            "abstract": "Entity Coreference Resolution is the task of resolving all mentions in a document that refer to the same real world entity and is considered as one of the most difficult tasks in natural language understanding. It is of great importance for downstream natural language processing tasks such as entity linking, machine translation, summarization, chatbots, etc. This work aims to give a detailed review of current progress on solving Coreference Resolution using neural-based approaches. It also provides a detailed appraisal of the datasets and evaluation metrics in the field, as well as the subtask of Pronoun Resolution that has seen various improvements in the recent years. We highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the approaches, the challenges of the task, the lack of agreed-upon standards in the task and propose a way to further expand the boundaries of the field.",

Thus, the eyes have shown to play a significant role in these visual communication practices and, therefore, many various researches have adopted methodologies, specifically eye-tracking, to understand the gaze patterns and analyze the behavior of DHH individuals. In this paper, we provide a literature review from 55 papers and data analysis from eye-tracking studies concerning hearing impairment, attention management strategies, and their mode of communication such as Visual and Textual based communication. Through this survey, we summarize the findings and provide future research directions.",

            "abstract": "Adding American Sign Language (ASL) versions of information content to websites can improve information accessibility for many people who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (DHH) who may have lower levels of English literacy. Generating animations from a script representation would enable this content to be easily updated, yet software is needed that can set detailed speed and timing parameters for such animations, which prior work has revealed to be critical for their understandability and acceptance among DHH users. Despite recent work on predicting these parameters using AI models trained on recordings of human signers, no prior work had examined whether DHH users actually prefer for these speed and timing properties to be similar to humans, or to be exaggerated, e.g. for additional clarity. We conducted two empirical studies to investigate preferences of ASL signers for speed and timing parameters of ASL animations, including: sign duration, transition time, differential signing rate, pause length, and pausing frequency. Our first study (N=20) identified two preferred values from among five options for each parameter, one of which included a typical human value for this parameter, and a second study (N=20) identified the most preferred value. We found that while ASL signers preferred pause length and frequency to be similar to those of humans, they actually preferred animations to have faster signs, slower transitions, and less dynamic variation in differential signing speed, as compared to the timing of human signers. This study provides specific empirical guidance for creators of future ASL animation technologies, and more broadly, it demonstrates that it is not safe to assume that ASL signers will simply prefer for properties of ASL animations to be as similar as possible to human signers.",

The book begins by presenting the essentials of usability testing, which include focusing on the user and not the product; knowing when to conduct small or large studies; and thinking of usability as hill climbing. It then reviews testing options and places usability testing into the context of a user-centered design (UCD). It goes on to discuss the planning, preparation, and implementation of a usability test. The remaining chapters cover the analysis and reporting of usability test findings, and the unique aspects of international usability testing. This book will be useful to anyone else involved in the development or support of any type of product, such as software or web developers, engineers, interaction designers, information architects, technical communicators, visual or graphic designers, trainers, user-assistance specialists, and instructional technologists.",

By analyzing popular empathy activities aimed at understanding people with disabilities, we examine the ways empathy works to both powerfully and problematically align designers with the values of people who may use their products. Drawing on disability studies and feminist theorizing, we describe how acts of empathy building may further distance people with disabilities from the processes designers intend to draw them into. We end by reimagining empathy as guided by the lived experiences of people with disabilities who are traditionally positioned as those to be empathized.",

            "abstract": "This paper aims to elevate stories of design by people with disabilities. In particular, we draw from counter-storytelling practices to build a corpus of stories that prioritize disabled people as contributors to professional design practice. Across a series of workshops with disabled activists, designers, and developers, we developed the concept of biographical prototypes: under-recognized first-person accounts of design materialized through prototyping practices. We describe how the creation of such prototypes helps position disabled people as central contributors to the design profession. The artifacts engendered an expanded sense of coalition among workshop participants while prompting reflection on tensions between recognition and obligation. We end by reflecting on how the prototypes-and the practices that produced them-complement a growing number of design activities around disability that reveal complexities around structural forms of discrimination and the generative role that personal accounts may play in their revision.",

In this paper, we report on interviews with screen reader users who were also Black, Indigenous, People of Color, Non-binary, and/or Transgender on their current image description practices and preferences, and experiences negotiating theirs and others’ appearances non-visually. We discuss these perspectives, and the ethics of humans and AI describing appearance characteristics that may convey the race, gender, and disabilities of those photographed. In turn, we share considerations for more carefully describing appearance, and contexts in which such information is perceived salient. Finally, we offer tensions and questions for accessibility research to equitably consider politics and ecosystems in which technologies will embed, such as potential risks of human and AI biases amplifying through image descriptions.",

            "abstract": "We describe the primary ways researchers can determine the size of a sample of research participants, present the benefits and drawbacks of each of those methods, and focus on improving one method that could be useful to the CHI community: local standards. To determine local standards for sample size within the CHI community, we conducted an analysis of all manuscripts published at CHI2014. We find that sample size for manuscripts published at CHI ranges from 1 – 916,000 and the most common sample size is 12. We also find that sample size differs based on factors such as study setting and type of methodology employed. The outcome of this paper is an overview of the various ways sample size may be determined and an analysis of local standards for sample size within the CHI community. These contributions may be useful to researchers planning studies and reviewers evaluating the validity of results.",

            "abstract": "Voice-based Intelligent Virtual Assistants&nbsp;(IVAs) promise to improve healthcare management and Quality of Life&nbsp;(QOL) by introducing the paradigm of hands-free and eye-free interactions. However, there has been little understanding regarding the challenges for designing such systems for older adults, especially when it comes to healthcare related tasks. To tackle this, we consider the processes of care delivery and QOL enhancements for older adults as a collaborative task between patients and providers. By interviewing 16 older adults living independently or semi–independently and 5 providers, we identified 12&nbsp;barriers that older adults might encounter during daily routine and while managing health. We ultimately highlighted key design challenges and opportunities that might be introduced when integrating voice-based IVAs into the life of older adults. Our work will benefit practitioners who study and attempt to create full-fledged IVA-powered smart devices to deliver better care and support an increased QOL for aging populations.",

In this study, we propose a framework for the design of tools to support teaching to children with disabilities. The framework provides the necessary stages for the development of tools (hardware-based or software-based) and must be adapted for a specific disability and educational goal. For this study, the framework was adapted to support literacy teaching and contributes to the design of educational/interactive technology for deaf people while making them part of the design process and taking into account their particular needs. The experts’ evaluation of the framework shows that it is well structured and may be adapted for other types of disabilities.",

In this paper we present an exploratory study focusing on evaluation of Sound Forest based on picture cards and interviews. Since Sound Forest should be accessible for everyone, regardless age or abilities, we invited children, teens and adults with physical and intellectual disabilities to take part in the evaluation. The main contribution of this work lies in its findings suggesting that multisensory platforms such as Sound Forest, providing whole-body vibrations, can be used to provide visitors of different ages and abilities with similar associations to musical experiences. Interviews also revealed positive responses to haptic feedback in this context. Participants of different ages used different strategies and bodily modes of interaction in Sound Forest, with activities ranging from running to synchronized music-making and collaborative play.",

            "abstract": "Drones have become fixtures in commerce, safety efforts, and in homes as a leisure activity. Researchers have started to explore how drones can support people with disabilities in piloting and serve as assistive devices. Our work focuses on people with vision impairment and investigates what motivates them to fly drones. We administered a survey to visually impaired adults that gauged general interest in drone piloting and previous experience with drones. From the 59 survey responses, we interviewed 13 participants to elaborate on how they envision using drones and how different feedback and modes of piloting can make the flying experience more accessible. We found that our participants had overarching interests in aviation, trying new technology, environment exploration, and finding collaborative activities to do with their sighted family members, which extended to an interest in piloting drones. This research helps lay groundwork for design scenarios and accessible features for future drones.",

            "abstract": "Stuttering is a speech disorder which impacts the personal and professional lives of millions of people worldwide. To save themselves from stigma and discrimination, people who stutter (PWS) may adopt different strategies to conceal their stuttering. One of the common strategies is word substitution where an individual avoids saying a word they might stutter on and use an alternative instead. This process itself can cause stress and add more burden. In this work, we present Fluent, an AI augmented writing tool which assists PWS in writing scripts which they can speak more fluently. Fluent embodies a novel active learning based method of identifying words an individual might struggle pronouncing. Such words are highlighted in the interface. On hovering over any such word, Fluent presents a set of alternative words which have similar meaning but are easier to speak. The user is free to accept or ignore these suggestions. Based on such user interaction (feedback), Fluent continuously evolves its classifier to better suit the personalized needs of each user. We evaluated our tool by measuring its ability to identify difficult words for 10 simulated users. We found that our tool can identify difficult words with a mean accuracy of over 80 20 interactions and it keeps improving with more feedback. Our tool can be beneficial for certain important life situations like giving a talk, presentation, etc. The source code for this tool has been made publicly accessible at github.com/bhavyaghai/Fluent.",

            "abstract": "Environmental concerns have driven an interest in sustainable smart cities, through the monitoring and optimisation of networked infrastructures. At the same time, there are concerns about who these interventions and services are for, and who benefits. HCI researchers and designers interested in civic life have started to call for the democratisation of urban space through resistance and political action to challenge state and corporate claims. This paper contributes to an emerging body of work that seeks to involve citizens in the design of sustainable smart cities, particularly in the context of marginalised and culturally diverse urban communities. We present a study involving co-designing Internet of Things with urban agricultural communities and discuss three ways in which design can participate in the right to the sustainable smart city through designing for the commons, care, and biocultural diversity.",

However, few resources exist for people with cognitive disabilities to learn computer science. In this paper, we document our observations of a successful program in which young adults with cognitive disabilities are trained in computing concepts. Through field observations and interviews, we identify instructional strategies used by this group, accessibility challenges encountered by this group, and how instructors and students leverage peer learning to support technical education. Our findings lead to guidelines for developing tools and curricula to support young adults with cognitive disabilities in learning computer science.",

            "abstract": "Roughly 1 in 3 people around the world are affected by cognitive or mental disabilities at some point in their lives, yet people often face a variety of barriers when seeking support and receiving diagnosis from healthcare professionals. While prior work found that people with such disabilities assess themselves using online tests and assessments, it remains unknown whether and how effectively these tests fill gaps in healthcare and general support systems. To find out, we interviewed 17 adults with cognitive or mental disabilities about their motivation for and experience using online tests. We learned that online tests act as an important resource that address the shortcomings in support systems for people with professionally diagnosed or suspected cognitive or mental disabilities. In particular, online tests can lower barriers to a professional diagnosis, provide valuable information about the nuances of a disability, and support people in forming a disability identity – an invaluable step towards a positive acceptance of oneself. Our results also uncovered challenges and risks that prevent people with known or suspected health conditions from fully taking advantage of online tests. Based on these findings, we discuss how online tests can be better leveraged to support people with cognitive or mental disabilities before and after professional diagnosis.",

            "abstract": "User-generated videos are an increasingly important source of information online, yet most online videos are inaccessible to blind and visually impaired (BVI) people. To find videos that are accessible, or understandable without additional description of the visual content, BVI people in our formative studies reported that they used a time-consuming trial-and-error approach: clicking on a video, watching a portion, leaving the video, and repeating the process. BVI people also reported video accessibility heuristics that characterize accessible and inaccessible videos. We instantiate 7 of the identified heuristics (2 audio-related, 2 video-related, and 3 audio-visual) as automated metrics to assess video accessibility. We collected a dataset of accessibility ratings of videos by BVI people and found that our automatic video accessibility metrics correlated with the accessibility ratings (Adjusted R2 = 0.642). We augmented a video search interface with our video accessibility metrics and predictions. BVI people using our augmented video search interface selected an accessible video more efficiently than when using the original search interface. By integrating video accessibility metrics, video hosting platforms could help people surface accessible videos and encourage content creators to author more accessible products, improving video accessibility for all.",

To understand current and historical trends, we created and analyzed a dataset of accessibility papers appearing at CHI and ASSETS since ASSETS’ founding in 1994. We qualitatively coded areas of focus and methodological decisions for the past 10 years (2010-2019, N=506 papers), and analyzed paper counts and keywords over the full 26 years (N=836 papers). Our findings highlight areas that have received disproportionate attention and those that are underserved—for example, over 43 papers in the past 10 years are on accessibility for blind and low vision people. We also capture common study characteristics, such as the roles of disabled and nondisabled participants as well as sample sizes (e.g., a median of 13 for participant groups with disabilities and older adults). We close by critically reflecting on gaps in the literature and offering guidance for future work in the field.",

            "abstract": "Novel AI-infused educational technologies can give children with blindness the opportunity to explore concepts learned incidentally through vision by using alternative perceptual modalities. However, more effort is needed to support the meaningful use of such technological innovations for evaluations at scale and later wide-spread adoption. This paper presents the development and pilot evaluation of a curriculum to enable educators to support blind learners’ self-exploration of social attention using the PeopleLens technology. We reflect on these learnings to present four design guidelines for creating curricula aimed to enable meaningful use. We then consider how formulations of “success” by our participants can help us think about ways of assessing efficacy in low-incidence disability groups. We conclude by arguing for our community to widen the scope of discourse around assistive technologies from design and engineering to include supporting their meaningful use.",

The world is complex; our tools need to match that complexity. Simplicity turns out to be more complex than we thought. In this provocative and informative book, Don Norman writes that the complexity of our technology must mirror the complexity and richness of our lives. It’s not complexity that’s the problem, it’s bad design. Bad design complicates things unnecessarily and confuses us. Good design can tame complexity. Norman gives us a crash course in the virtues of complexity. But even such simple things as salt and pepper shakers, doors, and light switches become complicated when we have to deal with many of them, each somewhat different. Managing complexity, says Norman, is a partnership. Designers have to produce things that tame complexity. But we too have to do our part: we have to take the time to learn the structure and practice the skills. This is how we mastered reading and writing, driving a car, and playing sports, and this is how we can master our complex tools. Complexity is good. Simplicity is misleading. The good life is complex, rich, and rewarding—but only if it is understandable, sensible, and meaningful.",

            "abstract": "Play is the work of children-but access to play is not equal from child to child. Having access to a place to play is a challenge for marginalized children, such as children with disabilities. For autistic children, playing with other children in the physical world may be uncomfortable or even painful. Yet, having practice in the social skills play provides is essential for childhood development. In this ethnographic work, I explore how one community uses the sense of place and the digital embodied experience in a virtual world specifically to give autistic children access to play with their peers. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, I demonstrate how various physical and virtual spaces work together to make play possible. Second, I demonstrate these spaces, though some of them are digital, are no more or less \"real\" than the physical spaces making up a schoolyard or playground.",

            "abstract": "Command-line interfaces (CLIs) remain a popular tool among developers and system administrators. Since CLIs are text-based interfaces, they are sometimes considered accessible alternatives to predominantly visual developer tools like IDEs. However, there is no systematic evaluation of the accessibility of CLIs in the literature. In this paper, we describe two studies with 12 developers on their experience of using CLIs with screen readers. Our findings show that CLIs have their own set of accessibility issues - the most important being CLIs are unstructured text interfaces. Based on our results, we provide a set of recommendations for improving the accessibility of command-line interfaces.",

            "abstract": "Despite efforts to support students with disabilities in higher education, few continue to pursue doctoral degrees in computing. We conducted an interview study with 12 blind and low vision, and 7 deaf and hard of hearing current and former doctoral students in computing to understand how graduate students adjust to inaccessibility and ineffective accommodations. We asked participants how they worked around inaccessibility, managed ineffective accommodations, and advocated for tools and services. Employing a lens of ableism in our analysis, we found that participants’ extra effort to address accessibility gaps gave rise to a burden of survival, which they sustained to meet expectations of graduate-level productivity. We recommend equitable solutions that acknowledge taken-for-granted workarounds and that actively address inaccessibility in the graduate school context.",

Our findings show limited research conducted on accessible wearable interactions (e.g., just four papers addressing smartwatch input), a disproportionate interest for hand gestures compared to other input modalities for wearable devices, and low numbers of participants with motor impairments involved in user studies about wearable interactions (a median of 6.0 and average of 8.2 participants per study). We compile an inventory of 92 finger, hand, head, shoulder, eye gaze, and foot gesture commands for smartwatches, smartglasses, headsets, earsets, fitness trackers, data gloves, and armband wearable devices extracted from the scientific literature that we surveyed. Based on our findings, we propose four directions for future research on accessible wearable interactions for users with motor impairments.",

            "abstract": "Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices enable speech-based communication, but generating speech is not the only resource needed to have a successful conversation. Being able to signal one wishes to take a turn by raising a hand or providing some other cue is critical in securing a turn to speak. Experienced conversation partners know how to recognize the nonverbal communication an augmented communicator (AC) displays, but these same nonverbal gestures can be hard to interpret by people who meet an AC for the first time. Prior work has identified motion-based AAC as a viable and underexplored modality for increasing ACs’ agency in conversation. We build on this prior work to dig deeper into a particular case study on motion-based AAC by co-designing a physical expressive object to support ACs during conversations. We found that our physical expressive object could support communication with unfamiliar partners. As such, we present our process and resulting lessons on the designed object itself and the co-design process.",

            "abstract": "In the Social Web scenario, where large amounts of User Generated Content diffuse through Social Media, the risk of running into misinformation is not negligible. For this reason, assessing and mining the credibility of both sources of information and information itself constitute nowadays a fundamental issue. Credibility, also referred as believability, is a quality perceived by individuals, who are not always able to discern with their cognitive capacities genuine information from the fake one. For this reason, in the recent years several approaches have been proposed to automatically assess credibility in Social Media. Most of them are based on data-driven models, i.e., they employ machine-learning techniques to identify misinformation, but recently also model-driven approaches are emerging, as well as graph-based approaches focusing on credibility propagation. Since multiple social applications have been developed for different aims and in different contexts, several solutions have been considered to address the issue of credibility assessment in Social Media. Three of the main tasks facing this issue and considered in this article concern: (1) the detection of opinion spam in review sites, (2) the detection of fake news and spam in microblogging, and (3) the credibility assessment of online health information. Despite the high number of interesting solutions proposed in the literature to tackle the above three tasks, some issues remain unsolved; they mainly concern both the absence of predefined benchmarks and gold standard datasets, and the difficulty of collecting and mining large amount of data, which has not yet received the attention it deserves.

            "abstract": "Technology for disabled people is often developed by non-disabled populations, producing an environment where the perspectives of disabled researchers - particularly when they clash with normative ways of approaching accessible technology - are denigrated, dismissed or treated as invalid. This epistemic violence has manifest material consequences for our lives as disabled researchers engaging with work on our own states of being. Through a series of vignettes, we illustrate our experiences and the associated pain that comes with such engagement as well as the consequences of pervasive dehumanization of ourselves through existing works. Our aim is to identify the epistemic injustice disabled people experience within HCI, to question the epistemological base of knowledge production leading to said injustice and to take ownership of a narrative that all too often is created without our participation.",

            "abstract": "Many accessibility features available on mobile platforms require applications (apps) to provide complete and accurate metadata describing user interface (UI) components. Unfortunately, many apps do not provide sufficient metadata for accessibility features to work as expected. In this paper, we explore inferring accessibility metadata for mobile apps from their pixels, as the visual interfaces often best reflect an app’s full functionality. We trained a robust, fast, memory-efficient, on-device model to detect UI elements using a dataset of 77,637 screens (from 4,068 iPhone apps) that we collected and annotated. To further improve UI detections and add semantic information, we introduced heuristics (e.g., UI grouping and ordering) and additional models (e.g., recognize UI content, state, interactivity). We built Screen Recognition to generate accessibility metadata to augment iOS VoiceOver. In a study with 9 screen reader users, we validated that our approach improves the accessibility of existing mobile apps, enabling even previously inaccessible apps to be used.",
